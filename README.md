## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://your-repository-url/eatwise-india.git
    cd eatwise-india
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or if you prefer yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Google AI API key:
    ```env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
    ```
    You can obtain a Google AI API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

4.  **Run the Genkit Development Server (for AI features):**
    Open a new terminal window/tab and run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    Or for auto-reloading on changes to AI flows:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    The Genkit UI will typically be available at `http://localhost:4000`.

5.  **Run the Next.js Development Server:**
    In another terminal window/tab, run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

A brief overview of key directories:

*   `src/app/`: Contains the Next.js pages and layouts (App Router).
    *   `src/app/analyze/`: Food label analysis page and components.
    *   `src/app/recipes/`: Recipe suggestion page and components.
    *   `src/app/nutrition-check/`: Nutrition facts analysis page and components.
    *   `src/app/blogs/`: Blog pages and components.
*   `src/ai/`: Houses Genkit related code.
    *   `src/ai/flows/`: Defines the AI flows (e.g., health report generation, recipe suggestions).
    *   `src/ai/genkit.ts`: Genkit initialization and configuration.
*   `src/components/`: Shared UI components.
    *   `src/components/ui/`: ShadCN UI components.
    *   `src/components/layout/`: Header, Footer, etc.
    *   `src/components/common/`: Other reusable common components.

*   `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks.
*   `src/lib/`: Utility functions and libraries.
*   `public/`: Static assets (including images in `public/img/`).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

*   `npm run dev`: Runs the Next.js app in development mode with Turbopack.
*   `npm run genkit:dev`: Starts the Genkit development server.
*   `npm run genkit:watch`: Starts the Genkit development server with auto-reload on AI flow changes.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the Next.js app for production.
*   `npm run start`: Starts the Next.js production server.
*   `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase using Next.js's built-in ESLint configuration.
*   `npm run typecheck`: Runs TypeScript type checking.

## Environment Variables

*   `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: **Required**. Your API key for Google AI services (Gemini).

Make sure to add this to your `.env` file for local development. For production deployments (e.g., Vercel, Firebase), set this as an environment variable in your hosting provider's settings. Do not commit your `.env` file to version control.

## Deployment

This Next.js application can be deployed to any platform that supports Next.js, such as Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase App Hosting (an `apphosting.yaml` is included).

**Important:** For Genkit AI flows to work in production, you MUST set the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable in your deployment environment's settings.

### Deploying on Vercel

1.  Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2.  Import the repository into Vercel.
3.  In the Vercel project settings, navigate to the **Environment Variables** section.
4.  Add a new environment variable with the name `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and paste your key as the value.
5.  Redeploy your application. The AI features should now work correctly.
