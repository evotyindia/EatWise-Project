## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>/eatwise-india.git
    cd eatwise-india
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or if you prefer yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Google AI API key:
    ```env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
    NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://eatwise.evotyindia.me 
    ```
    You can obtain a Google AI API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to `http://localhost:3000` for local development if needed, or your production URL.

4.  **Run the Genkit Development Server (for AI features):**
    Open a new terminal window/tab and run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    Or for auto-reloading on changes to AI flows:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    The Genkit UI will typically be available at `http://localhost:4000`.

5.  **Run the Next.js Development Server:**
    In another terminal window/tab, run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

*   `npm run dev`: Runs the Next.js app in development mode with Turbopack.
*   `npm run genkit:dev`: Starts the Genkit development server.
*   `npm run genkit:watch`: Starts the Genkit development server with auto-reload on AI flow changes.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the Next.js app for production.
*   `npm run start`: Starts the Next.js production server.
*   `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase using Next.js's built-in ESLint configuration.
*   `npm run typecheck`: Runs TypeScript type checking.

## Environment Variables

*   `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: **Required**. Your API key for Google AI services (Gemini).
*   `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`: **Required for correct sitemap and metadata generation.** Set to your production domain (e.g., `https://eatwise.evotyindia.me`) or `http://localhost:3000` for local development.

Make sure to add these to your `.env` file for local development. For production deployments (e.g., Vercel, Firebase), set these as environment variables in your hosting provider's settings. Do not commit your `.env` file to version control.

## Deployment

This Next.js application can be deployed to any platform that supports Next.js, such as Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase App Hosting (an `apphosting.yaml` is included).

For Genkit flows to work in production, ensure your deployment environment has the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable set.
Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is set to your production domain for correct SEO and link generation.
