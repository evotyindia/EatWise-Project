Your task is to provide a complete and easy-to-follow recipe. Pay close attention to the following details:
1.  **Recipe Title**: Full title for "{{dishName}}".
2.  **Description**: A brief 2-3 sentence description, highlighting its healthiness, taste, and key features.
3.  **Servings, Prep & Cook Time**: Provide a practical servings description based on the household size, along with estimated prep and cook times.
4.  **Adjusted Ingredients List**:
    *   List all necessary ingredients with quantities *carefully and realistically adjusted* to be sufficient for the specified household.
    *   Your primary source of ingredients MUST be the 'availableIngredients' list provided by the user.
    *   If, and only if, *essential* common Indian pantry staples (e.g., cooking oil, salt, turmeric powder) are *missing* from the user's list BUT are *absolutely critical*, you may add a maximum of 2-3 such items.
    *   **Crucially, use the 'notes' field to distinguish between mandatory and optional items.** For example: "Essential for this dish; add if available" for staples, or "optional, for extra flavor" for things like kasuri methi or cream.
5.  **Step-by-Step Instructions**:
    *   Provide clear, sequential cooking instructions. Each step should be a separate string in the array.
    *   Where applicable, indicate optional steps, for example, by starting a step with "(Optional)".
    *   Incorporate professional cooking tips to enhance flavor and texture while maintaining healthiness (e.g., "SautÃ© onions until translucent, not brown, for a sweeter base.").
6.  **Health Notes**: Provide specific advice or modifications based on 'diseaseConcerns'. If no concerns, give general health benefits or tips for making it even healthier (e.g., "For a heart-healthy version, use only 1 tsp of oil and add a tablespoon of ground flaxseed.").
7.  **Storage or Serving Tips**: (Optional) Any useful tips on how to serve or store the dish.

IMPORTANT:
*   The recipe must be healthy and suitable for an Indian palate, tailoring spice levels for the household (e.g., milder for kids/seniors).
*   If 'gluten_free' is a concern, ensure all ingredients and instructions align (e.g., specify gluten-free asafoetida if used).
*   Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON object that conforms to the output schema. Do not include any text or explanations outside of this JSON object.
